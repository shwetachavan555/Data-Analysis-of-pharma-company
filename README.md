# Data-Analysis-of-pharma-company
# This dashboard provides a high-level overview of the performance and inventory status for a pharmaceutical company. Overall, the company shows strong performance in the Diabetes and Gastro categories, driven largely by top manufacturers like ABC Pharma.

# 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  Total Quantity Sold: 25K units.

  Total Quantity in Stock: 136K units (suggesting a healthy buffer, though potentially high holding costs).

  Product Diversity: The company operates across 8 distinct categories.

# 2. Sales & Revenue Analysis
 Top Category by Revenue: Diabetes is the clear leader, generating 26.6K in total amount, followed by Gastro (18.6K) and Pain Relief (18.0K).

 Top Manufacturers: ABC Pharma (36.0K) and HealthPlus (32.0K) are the primary revenue drivers, significantly outperforming other suppliers like BioCare and XYZ Lifesciences.

 Top Clients: Sales are relatively well-distributed among top clients, with Scott Inc (4.0K), Bauer, Cook and Fletcher (3.9K), and Johnson, Miller and Velasquez (3.8K) being the leading purchasers.

# 3. Market Share (Quantity Sold)
 The pie chart reveals a fairly balanced distribution of units sold:

 Diabetes leads in volume as well, accounting for 20.7% of total sales.

 Anti-fungal (14.84%) and Gastro (13.58%) follow closely.

 Vitamins represent the smallest share of units sold at only 5.23%.

# 4. Inventory & Reorder Management
 The relationship between Quantity in Stock and Reorder Level highlights the supply chain health:

 High Stock Levels: Diabetes (23.0K) and Vitamins (21.4K) have the highest stock on hand.

 Reorder Safety: Most categories appear to have stock levels significantly higher than their reorder points. For instance, while Diabetes has a reorder level of 5.1K, it currently holds 23.0K, indicating no        immediate risk of stockouts.

# Antibiotics have the lowest stock levels (11.5K) but also a low reorder trigger (2.7K).

# Summary Observations
Strengths: The Diabetes segment is the "powerhouse" of the business, leading in revenue, volume, and stock priority.

Efficiency Opportunity: The "Vitamins" category has the second-highest stock level (21.4K) but the lowest sales volume (5.23%). This may indicate overstocking or slow-moving inventory that is tying up capital.

Supplier Reliance: The company is heavily reliant on ABC Pharma and HealthPlus; any supply chain disruption with these two could impact over 50% of revenue.
